///Which variants are present in which samples?//
Sample SRR2584403_1 has two intergenic SNV:
1329520	T->G and 4141016	C->A

Sample SRR2584404_1 has the same two SNVs noted above, in addition to a deletion at 
806310 ATT -> AT and a SNV at 238917 G->T

Sample SRR2584857_1 has 4 SNVs, none of which are found in the above listed files:
920514	T->C; 3931002	A->C; 4141441	C->T; 4202391	T->G
as well as an insertion from 4530778-4530779 AACCCT.

SRR2584405_1 has 41 SNVs and 1 insertion, which all appear to be unique to that file. 
It seems like a lot to list them here but I can if desired.


//Which variants are shared between two or more samples?//
1329520	T->G and 4141016	C->A are both in samples SRR2584403_1  and SRR2584404_1.


//Are there any variants that stand out in terms of their likely biological impact?
Name variants by location and give both the reference and sample alleles as in the VCF file.//

238917 G->T is an upstream gene variant. There are 5 upstream gene variants and 15 
downstream gene variants in SRR2584405_1. These are more likely to have biological impact,
but are not as damning as a mutation within genes themselves, of which there are none.
All others mutations identified here are intergenic and by convential thought are likely 
to be not biologically significant (though I admittedly have some "hot takes" on noncoding DNA mutations).
